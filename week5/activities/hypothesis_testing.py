''' Activity to introduce the concept and implementation of hypothesis testing.

This activity is meant to help you practice Pythonic programming. Pythonic
programming means to code for humans, not for computers. One of the clearest
and most efficient ways to write your programs is to write their purpose and
their functionalities first. The code below consists of the first steps of
efficient programming.

Modular coding is key to success! The coder in this case has recognized what
the separate tasks are in their problem and wrote them into individual
functions. You will notice that there is no code written though! The coder has
designed their code before writing it. You will notice each function has a
number of arguments and a docstring (documentation) describing the arguments of
the function.

Your job is to finish the code.

Perform the activity in the following way:
    1. Read each of the functions, their arguments, and their docstrings.

    2. Discuss with your group how to implement the design to solve the problem
    at hand.

    3. Implement the code in pairs or as a single group.

    4. Perform any additional analysis on your results to test their validity.

    5. Choose an individual presenter. Prepare a short presentation < 3 min to
    present to the class on how you solved the problem and what your results
    are. Discuss with the class what were the weaknesses of the design and what
    you would change.
