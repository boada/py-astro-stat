''' Activity to introduce the concept and implementation of the KS test.

This activity is meant to help you practice Pythonic programming. Pythonic
programming means to code for humans, not for computers. One of the clearest
and most efficient ways to write your programs is to write their purpose and
their functionalities first. The code below consists of the first steps of
efficient programming.

Modular coding is key to success! The coder in this case has recognized what
the separate tasks are in their problem and wrote them into individual
functions. You will notice that there is no code written though! The coder has
designed their code before writing it. You will notice each function has a
number of arguments and a docstring (documentation) describing the arguments of
the function.

Your job is to finish the code.

Perform the activity in the following way:
    1. Read each of the functions, their arguments, and their docstrings.
    Overall instructions will be under the main() function.

    2. Discuss with your group how to implement the design to solve the problem
    at hand.

    3. Implement the code in pairs or as a single group.

    4. Perform any additional analysis on your results to test their validity.

    5. Choose an individual presenter. Prepare a short presentation < 3 min to
    present to the class on how you solved the problem and what your results
    are. Discuss with the class what were the weaknesses of the design and what
    you would change.

The function at the bottom, main(), is where you will write your script. Python
sets the __name__ variable to be equal to '__main__' in this case, thus the
script will execute the main() function. This is a common and composed way to
write scripts in Python.

    ''' Your goal is to recalculate the luminosity function for the red and
    blue galaxies presented in the lower right of Figure 4.10 using
    reproducible methods for histogram binning.

    Use the most appropriate binning strategy for the data. Plot the results on
    the same scale and limits as the code in the example script.

    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
